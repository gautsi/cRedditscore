This is not really true.  They were able to make that claim in court because they have the word ""reverent"" in the scout law (""A scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent""), but really nothing the scouts do has anything directly to do with religion.  It's an organization that is designed to help city kids connect with nature, learn survival silks, and get people to appreciate the outdoors; religious education is just not something they do at all.

Imagine, if we forced all troops to allow openly gay leaders, how many troops would we lose? How many would shift to groups such as Trail Life USA (which was created because they thought allowing gay youth was wrong) where people would share and entrench the youth with their bigoted ideals?

If so I can see that as a mitigating factor, while I still think they should enforce non discrimination I can understand how allowing highly autonomous local clubs to discriminate isn't *as bad* as if they weren't autonomous.


As for ensuring that you don't just lose members I would have to really question how much use that is, if these local groups are so autonomous and so religiously fundamentalist that they would leave if they had to accept gay leaders (assuming social pressure and soft discrimination didn't make the rule uneforcable) are they really being made any less homophobic by staying in the organisation? The comparative here seems to be between the kids being in a bigoted scout group and something like trail life.


At least if the bigoted clubs ""secede"" en masse that at least has the effect of marking them. Right now having their discrimination tolerated normalises it and tells people it's okay. It tells kids that kicking out their gay leader is a normal ok thing. When you put an end to that local leaders need to be upfront and say they're leaving the larger organisation because they don't want gay leaders. It's a lot easier to maintain some vague ""christian values"" rules than to announce that you're going to ""secede"" over being homophobic. More apathetic members and parents won't stand for that even if they previously tolerated the discrimination.

Nor would a dynamic language help you in solving any of those problems.

Telling you that your code is incorrect, where it is incorrect, and (oftentimes) how to fix it is a pretty darn good excuse to have your workflow interrupted. It's like a fighter pilot complaining about his or her airplane's Ground Proximity Alarm system interrupting their flying.

> The strict compile/edit/run cycle doesn't encourage to implement things in the order where you can verify they work.

As opposed to what? The run/fix runtime errors/run again cycle in dynamic languages? That just shifts the problem downstream, where it's potentially more difficult to understand and solve.

I think most people would agree that intellisense is actually one of the great benefits of using statically typed languages. I personally find it a great productivity enhancer and time saver. Visual Studio works nearly flawlessly with Unity in my experience. So I would agree with you that it's probably your IDE. 

Even if the IDE was that big a hindrance, there's nothing stopping you from ditching it altogether and using a plain ol' text editor instead.

> I'm usually checking out when someone is trying to say there's something advantageous in statically typed languages, this far it has always seemed that the claimed advantages really aren't as significant as what they've been touted as.

Sounds like you made your mind to make your mind on the subject. Maybe John Carmack might be able to persuade you to have more sympathy for the dark side. He has an [article](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/128836/InDepth_Static_Code_Analysis.php) on Gamasutra on static code analysis, which is like compilations cranked to eleven, and relies on having a static typing. In it, he says that:

> The most important thing I have done as a programmer in recent years is to aggressively pursue static code analysis. Even more valuable than the hundreds of serious bugs I have prevented with it is the change in mindset about the way I view software reliability and code quality.

There appears to be large scale projects that have been successfully written in both dynamically and statically typed languages.

As to C# preventing your code from executing because of compilation errors, I think that writing a computer program as a collection of incomplete, non-compiling fragments isn't a common practice. If you need to freestyle it that bad then you should use comment blocks or maybe even place those fragments in a more suitable place, like a text file or something.

Carmack's article wasn't about ""tightness"" as you've put it. It was about correctness, i.e. writing code with less bugs. Using C++ and not using ""high level features"" have no bearing on his conclusion: That static typing allows static type analysis, and static type analysis can potentially contribute to better correctness. In that particular regard, i.e. allowing static type analysis, static typing _is_ superior to dynamic typing. No one said that static typing is automatically superior in all aspects; as I said before, it's a trade off. 

Regarding the final paragraph in your post, I admire the confidence you have in dismissing other people's experience as mere claims that don't hold up to your own. But John Carmack's own distilled wisdom isn't something I would so readily dismiss. Same goes for all major JavaScript frameworks (with the exception of Backbone.js) switching to transpilers that add more strict type checking to the language. And same goes for Python adding [type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) to the language to facilitate static code analysis and integration with statically typed languages.

Problem with C# is that it doesn't just tell that my code is incorrect. It also prevents the program from executing. If we go with aeronautics references, it's more like your ground proximity alarm system would blare at 10km altitude because you didn't keep the plane straight. It's additional work required to test the program. If there's an error, it happens when I'm interested about how that part of the code works. Otherwise knowing that ahead of the time doesn't provide me any advantage.

With intellisence I tend to have situations that I write something like ""body"", and it completes it into ""BodyCream"" when I press dot, without me entirely even noticing that at every time. It violates my expectations about what the code will be after certain keystrokes.

Problem in that article is that Carmack comes from C/C++ background.

You seem to be dismissing Carmack's article based on two false assumptions:

* **That memory leaks are not present in dynamically typed languages,** which in simply not true. See [this](http://javascript.info/tutorial/memory-leaks) for a JavaScript example and [this](http://www.lshift.net/blog/2008/11/14/tracing-python-memory-leaks/) for Python.
*  **That detecting memory leaks is the only benefit of static type analysis,** which is also not true. IntelliSense and robust refactoring tools, for example, are extremely valuable. 

I'm also sure that the aforementioned JavaScript frameworks using transpilers and Python adding type hints had many other good reasons for desiring type safety.

I use Python frequently and have used Ruby in anger in the recent past, and I have never found littering my projects with code fragments that don't run. And I've seeing this method of coding that you claim to be so prevalent in any of the programming courses or code katas that I have watched. Yours to be a rather peculiar style of coding, but each to his own. 

&nbsp;

> Say you're adding floats and integers together. The integer must coerce into the float. That's what I basically experience when writing C# instead of python.

I'm sorry to meme at you, but if you're finding yourself manually casting your integers to floats with such frequency that it's hindering your workflow, then you're doing it wrong(TM).

> It only doesn't make the initial version expensive to write. If you realise that instead of vector3 you need a vector4, you have to rewrite lots of type declarations.

`Vector4` isn't simply a better version of `Vector3`. The former is used to solve computations for which the latter wouldn't make any sense. So if you find yourself changing from one to the other, then you're doing it because you're changing the problem you're trying to solve and the algorithm that solves it, in which case changing the type declaration is the least of your worries. 

It's like changing the way you represent rotations from Euler (which fits into a `Vector3`) to quaternion (which needs a `Vector4`). Sure, you'll have to change the type declarations, but you'll also have to change heaps of code since the math is entirely incompatible between the two.

> In python you can just put it in and work through the code in the order where issues arise on your tests. You may propose refactoring, but to put it bluntly: those tools do not entirely solve this.

So you're suggesting that automated refactoring followed by a compilation step that verifies the results of that refactoring is actually *inferior* to manual run-and-pray testing. Or maybe you think that a writing, maintaining a unit test is somehow superior to something that a compiler gives you for free. I'm sorry, but I don't follow your logic here.

There's a feedback loop here: if bugs don't get fixed and/or the issue tracker isn't regularly used, fewer bugs will be reported.  Similarly, it's likely bug reporters have a natural rate-limit.  They're going to report at most X bugs per unit time, even if they find more - they'll just report what's most annoying.  These effects will tend smooth out differences between languages.

Then there's selection bias: repositories with more than 15 forks likely indicate a certain level of quality.  Excluding buggy software from your data sort of defeats the point.

The comparisons between languages based on actual programs is also probably not apples-to-apples either: people probably use languages that are appropriate to the task at hand, at least to some extent. Bugs tend to be easy to deal with in small projects (and may never get reported before they're fixed), and harder in larger, older and messier codebases.  If you write a few small perl scripts and they're all relatively bug free, and one large java programs with has quite a few bugs ... well, I'm not sure what this really tells you about the languages, but probably not much because the usecases are systematically different.

Then there's the fact that many projects don't use the github issue tracker to the same extent, which contributes to noise.  A social factor might also play a part: different groups use github differently - so correlation (between language and bug-proneness) may well not imply causation: Perhaps some languages score poorly because they're used by beginners, and others score highly because bugs are traditionally emailed in that community (or whatever).

Then, there's likely publication bias going on here. I suspect the author iteratively refined his model, and he almost certainly peeked at the results in between. And that means he - albeit unintentionally - may be tuning various parts of his data selection+analysis to confirm pre-held beliefs. With data this tricky, it's almost impossible to entirely avoid.

That's because the person doing the safety ratings defined safety *in terms of* static features.  Having programmed in dynamic languages, I don't regard most of those features as ""safety"".

To me, they look like someone is confusing *errors* with *bugs*.  People who focus on static safety are worried about things like null pointers, but in a dynamic language the existence of null values is a feature, not a bug.  Frankly, I might *intentionally* write code in such a way that it gets an error as the result of being passed a null value.  Exceptions are often part of normal control flow in a dynamic language -- Python especially!

Errors and bugs are not the same thing, but if you're looking for a way to measure ""safety"", it's a lot easier to count features that help you avoid errors than ones that help you avoid bugs.

Perhaps you're not aware that statically typed languages like Ocaml, Haskell, and Rust have the Option or Maybe type. This is similar to null, in that you can represent ""this is a missing value"".

I often like to think that some languages are easy to learn, whether other languages are hard. If we consider a large pool of people of different skill, than harder languages will have a natural barrier that makes lowly educated people go choose a different language. And those people then produce more bugs on those other languages (possibly).


Another important feature to consider here is how easy bugs can be diagnosed and fixed. In a language that makes it easy to find and fix bugs, people may be less concerned about releasing code with bugs. It your language makes it a real pain to find a bug, you'll be much more careful in writing complex code.

And another way to consider this is to think about what kind of project each language is being used for. Like: Javascript is a language used a lot for the kind of project where bugs happen a lot, whereas clojure is used in projects where bugs are not prone to happen.

Assuming you have the right libraries, Python does a much better job of conveying intent:

    for i in 2**[1,2,3,4]:

Makes it very clear that you are operating on a list of powers of two, whereas

    for (i = 1; i&lt;=N; i*=2)

Is pretty opaque at first glance.  It also has different implications depending on whether N is a power of two or not, especially in a nested loop.

The rest is knowing enough about IT to actually put your coding skills into worthwhile use.

This is most evident in example #5. Sure, you can write a loop with `curl` or `requests.get`, but chances are it's gonna be more complicated than that. If the page requires authentication, you need to know about cookies. Perhaps you need to pass other custom HTTP headers, too, like Referer. Or if you're especially unlucky, your plan may be foiled by some JavaScript logic on the page itself, in which case even scraping HTML won't save you unless you automate an actual web browser engine.

Just recognizing which of those situations apply to you, what is feasible and what is not, and -- most importantly -- whether it's _worthwhile_ or not, requires more than just being able to write a couple (hundred) lines of code.

Example #5 refers to [Chapter 11](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter11) of the book which covers web scraping. This includes using Selenium to control a browser when you need to log in to a site or use a web app that must run JavaScript. I was kind of stunned at how easy Selenium was to use, it's basically:

    from selenium import webdriver
    browser = webdriver.Firefox()
    browser.get('http://somewebsite.com')
    elem = browser.find_element_by_css_selector('some css selector')
    elem.send_keys('stuff to type into this element')
    elem.click() # or click it if it's a button

This way, you don't need to know about cookies, headers, etc. The browser works the way you expect and your code can control the browser.

But companies are usually unable to realize this until they actually hire programmers instead of clerks, and whether or not a company can afford to do so depends on their bottom line. Programmers are few and far between thanks to the current ""free-market"" mentality, and they do get snapped up by bigger companies who can afford them.

Makes it very clear that you are operating on a list of powers of two, whereas

Note that OP's code non-standardly uses `&lt;=` comparisons for the loop bounds, so you actually got the innermost `range` wrong ;)

At what point does the O( n ^2 ) communication between parties to verify the reduction step of each multiplication outweigh the benefit of just doing the calculation on your own machine in the first place?

Presumably, the point of this network is to harness the combined computing power of many users to achieve a FLOP or IOP rate much higher than you could achieve alone. However, the more users are working on your calculation, the communication between them must surely become unmanageable very quickly.

2)

As most cryptographic operations involve shifts, rotates, XORs as well as multiplications and additions, can your homorphic encryption handle all of these? Shifts and rotates I would imagine so, as it's basically multiply / divide by a power of two, and optionally adding at the LSB or MSB.

- cleaning up local commits before pushing them upstream
- trying out combinations of different commits by cherry picking them into different branches
- rewriting history to remove something that should never have been committed

I'm sure there are more examples, but these are the ones that come to mind. I don't think these are really that exceptional (well maybe the last one). My personal experience with Git has been that once I knew how to manipulate the commit graph, I found myself more ""free"" to try things. It changed the way I think about committing code, and the more I use Git, the more I find myself using these advanced features.

Having said all that, I do also think Git could be a little easier to use for newbies. Unlike with svn, perforce, and probably other CVSs, Git requires more effort to ramp up.

&gt; I guess I was wrong. 

bud, just a tip, if you want to inform people on issues, i'd suggest not acting like that, otherwise you just upset them, make them think you're a dick, and nothing gets taught.

but i digress, 

&gt;I challenge anyone to explain how the two: Verizon asking landlords to give exclusivity and Google demanding entire neighborhoods pledge to use their services before installation, are functionally different.

sure, i'll give you that the concept is KINDA similar, but it seems your conveniently overlooking one very important concept of this, WHEN they received the subsidiaries.

cause the situation is something to the degree of;

us to comcast/verizon: ""we give you tax breaks/subsidaries and you'll build this infrastructure for us yes?""

comcast/verizon to us: ""yeah absolutely""

*proceed to not build it*

""OOOOKAY we will... but only if we're the exclusive provider""

see that's ALREADY after they've received our incentives.

where as with google, there was no initial promise.

us to google: ""we'll give you incentives to build here!!! plz do!""

google to us: ""wait, hold on, lets do a survey of people to see if it's a worthwhile cause for us.""

When a variable percentage, which is unknown but is high, of people pledge to subscribe to google fiber, they do the installs. 

Fiberhoods have many fewer users than large New York City apartment buildings. 

I challenge anyone to explain how the two: Verizon asking landlords to give exclusivity and Google demanding entire neighborhoods pledge to use their services before installation, are **functionally** different.

They both do the same thing, they prevent fiber rollouts unless the provider can be guaranteed a return on their investment. 

A downside of the NYC arrangement is that it limits choice, but a downside of the Google fiber method is that users may not be able to connect to fiber that is literally across the street because not everyone on their block pledged to switch. 

The bottom line is that Google requires free dark fiber, free municipal comms closet space, free electricity, reduced cost or free permits, tax breaks, and free distribution cabinet space to roll out fiber and they only do it when enough subscribers sign an exclusivity agreement with them, and verizon does the same with similar subsidies and agreements with landlords instead of users. 

But one which limits choice on the provider end is bad and the other which limits choice on the consumer end is good. Or is it the other way around?

And source? I assumed this was common knowledge possessed by anyone who has ever read a single article about Google fiber. 

I guess I was wrong. 

&gt;Google sets its own thresholds for the needed number of customers to justify construction. If too few customers sign up in a neighborhood, Google sells to no homes in the area.

**NO.** 

All of this is right wing bullshit.

If embryos are humans, then **these must be true**:

-all abortions would be immediately criminalized, no exceptions for rape, incest, anything

-in vitro fertilization is mass murder

-miscarriages would require detectives to open homicide/manslaughter cases

-firefighters not saving petri dishes full of embryos would lose their jobs

The idea of ""no abortions because it is murder, but exception for rape and incest"" is a contradiction. But people rightly agree that forcing women to give birth to rapists' babies is barbaric, unless you are a wackjob Republican.

**The anti-abortion movement is not about saving the life of the baby. Never was, never will be. It was, and still is, about punishing women for having sex.** It isn't easy to demonize a middle aged infertile couple who wants kids. It is very easy to demonize a young woman who wants to have sex. The anti-abortion crusaders never give a damn about the welfare of the mothers or the babies - they're just scared about women controlling their own reproduction, having sex for fun, delaying childbearing, and going out in the workforce like it's the 21th century.

He says something along the lines of ""if A then B"", right? Only in the cases he listed, B does not follow A.

Firefighters would not be fired for failing to save petri dishes because even if those are equivalent to people, they're not fired for failing to save people either.

Sometimes it's impossible. Other times their supervisors rule that it's unsafe to make the attempt.

So right there, he does a triple non sequitur, ad absurdum, strawman.

Then his other one, about miscarriages requiring homicide investigations....

People die all the time from natural causes. They don't open investigations when someone dies unless there is reason to believe it was foul play. And in any event, miscarriage is a distinct class of misfortune and society could choose (has, in fact) to handle it differently than someone you can't tell if they were poisoned or had a heart attack.

Then the ""in vitro is mass murder""... murder requires you actually kill the person in question. In vitro doesn't kill any embryo, it just creates them.

All he has is bad logic, but it sounds outrageous and rallies those who already agree with him. 

&gt; I guess I just figure that the statements he's throwing out there, are falling under the assumption that a fertilized egg is considered life,

I don't even dispute it. That is the assumption.

But it's still bad logic.

The whole argument (for those that are informed) is that if a girl becomes pregnant, that baby will (unless there's complications) have a life. It will have a future. If the mother is poor, is it her place to never give that baby a chance? You can use the excuse of it ""not being fully developed,"" but why does it have to come to a certain point that we define him as ""human."" 

We live in a country, like it or not, where money defines happiness. And so if a woman does not have the money to raise a baby, she thinks it's better to not just have it. This is touching on a whole different problem though. The whole argument is based on potential. From conception, the fetus has the potential to grow and be happy. ""Well if it's aborted it's never truly living."" It's simply easier to get rid of it and forget about it. To not think about it. But from conception there is a new organism, whether it be one cell or many. That is an irrefutable fact.  It's up to humanity to decide when to be human. When to take responsibility.

Number of abortions in Texas in 2011 numbered around 75,000. 
https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/sfaa/texas.html

One in three women on average will receive an abortion in their lifetime in this country, the rate is slightly higher compared to miscarriage. 

There are around, oh, 30,000 children in the foster system here in Texas. If abortions were completely banned what do you think would happen to those numbers? 

How many children are adopted?
While inter-country adoption may be the most visible category, the majority of American adoptions actually involve children adopted out of foster care. About 135,000 children are adopted in the United States each year. Of non-stepparent adoptions, about 59 percent are from the child welfare (or foster) system, 26 percent are from other countries, and 15 percent are voluntarily relinquished American babies.
http://www.pbs.org/pov/offandrunning/adoption_fact_sheet.php

What I'm trying to say is if everyone in just Texas carried to term instead of aborting it would overwhelm the facilities. It would mean millions more children every year living literally off the government in foster homes.

Wouldn't it be more financially effective for our conservative right to actually give a damn about social services for these women and families and keep the children in the home and give them a chance instead of throwing them in a foster home? Particularly in the most undeserved areas of this country with the highest crime.

I live my life bottle to bottle, medication not alcohol.

I'm not sure theres any way to properly explain how they are, but insanity is what comes to mind.

I was diagnosed as having anxiety and depression at 15 and that was 20 years ago, mix in some self mutilation, extreme self loathing and suicidal ideation that still hits me to this day and I'm a mess of a man without my medication because my mind is essentially fucked up.

Maybe its not properly ""wired"", maybe it doesn't produce enough serotonin as as my old shrink figured way back when(this theory has been under very heavy scrutiny this last year) but without medication I'm fucked.

Thats not a happy way to live life really, bottle to bottle, having your body build up a tolerance to one medication and having to go on another to keep the effects of the pills working and wondering how many more it'll take as you age and how much more expensive it'll be.

Peace is something I only get when I'm sleeping, and thats why I understand her choice here because the one thing about suffering from depression I have realized is that it makes you see the world in a no bullshit perspective and you start to see things in black and white.

Thats a terrible way to see life, even if it may be realistic sometimes and all you want, more than anything else is some kind of peace. I hope she finds it, I hope its everything shes looking for because its a 1 way trip.

If Google had rewritten the interface code themselves (using different variable names, maybe different formatting), then SCOTUS may very well have taken up the case.

1) Rewrite everything in C#. They really didn't like this option.
2) Continue using Java without paying Oracle for a license and see what happens.

They went with option 2. The original judge made it clear that by doing so, because they chose to knowingly break the law (I'm drawing a blank on the legal term in cases like this one), the damages could be substantially higher.

I don't think you can be that black and white about it.  There is a lot of Java code out there that is pretty much purely computational, manipulates some data structures and runs some algorithms, and it all works fine in Android.  Yes, it's true that Android specifically decided not to be a compliant implementation of the JVM, because they felt they needed to do some things like file I/O and GUI components and even multithreading differently, to better fit the constraints of mobile devices.  But that doesn't stop you from reusing Java code that doesn't rely on those I/O and system-level features.

If the constraint to work with existing code were not there, you really think Android would have decided to use the same API as Java?  Seems pretty obvious to me that Java is there not because they wanted to save on the work of making up a new language or API, but because they wanted to save their developers the work of learning a new language and API, and of porting existing code when it could have been unnecessary.",programming,1,Supreme Court Denies Google Appeal on Oracle ,,1435587378,1594,johnmountain,538,1435706664.0,1435616178.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Contrary to all the hype from various tech blogs, this ruling changes nothing. As it stands, you already can't just copy someone else's software or API. If you tried to copy the Windows API and implement it yourself without a license, you would be sued. All this does is just extend copyright to the structure of an API. 

No, this does not mean you can copyright int add(int x, int y). One of the requirements for a copyright is originality, which is displayed in Java. Let's take java.util.Scanner. You can't just copy the package format java.util.Scanner (or the implementation) without the appropriate license (which Google did not have). However, if you changed it to my.awesome.package.utilities.scanner, then you would be fine. One of the requirements for a copyright is originality. The work must be original, and it must be original at the time it's created, not at some point in the future. java.util.Scanner was a creative, original structure at the point of creation. As stated in the opinion, Sun could have structure the packages any way they like (such as java.utilities.io.Scanner), which satisfies the creative requirements. 

In the case of this Oracle v Google, Google copied 7000 lines of declarations from the Java source code (about 37 packages). Google did not obtain a license to use this source code. They did not accept the GPL license provided by Sun/Oracle, nor did they negotiate a license with Sun/Oracle. Google refused to reimplement the JVM and several Java libraries in such a way that would support interoperability (even though they, Google, claimed it was important), which is a requirement of any license from Sun/Oracle. Java code MUST be able to work on ANY implementation of Java, which is not satisfied by Android. 

Google may still be fine under the fair use doctrine, but the jury was hung and there were not enough facts for the Court of Appeals to issue a ruling. However, it's also likely Google will not be fine due to Google's commercial interest in their reimplementation of those Java packages. 

The only thing this case reaffirmed is that you must read the license of what ever API you use. You can't just download a software package or use an API without reading the license. That should have been common sense for every programmer. A programming language is technically a software package, and the same rules apply. 

And no, this does not mean you can be sued because you happened to output a key-value pair ""name"":""Bob"" in a RESTful API. If you blatantly copy someone else's **original** API, then you can be sued. REST is a standard, and no one can make a copyright claim against it, just as Oracle can't make a copyright claim against the package.class.method format.

Actually, that's exactly what this was about, and most of the technology industry that understands what this is about believe *exactly* that it should be possible to just copy someone's API.  It's done all the time.  It is a huge part of how we got to the point we're at in the technology industry, where we have choices about pieces of software that interact with each other.

This is good for lawyers.   I need to find some broken down company where their copyright is commonly used by some rich companies.   Then buy the company and sue.   This is like patent 2.0.   But copyright can be retroactive and has far lower burden than patents.   This is ridiculous.

But as it is, they don't seem to be trying to make Android run normal Java code.

If you are a lawyer, then imagine if law firms could copyright legal terms. You could not write a legal document containing any of these terms without violating copyright. Every other law firm would need to come up with their own proprietary terminology to refer to the *same concepts*. And the various terminologies would make increasingly less sense, because the first firms to copyright will of course pick the most sensible sounding terms.

Sound terrible? See, the set of common legal terms is part of your API. You use them to perform logical operations on the other words in your legal document. The fact that they are shared/common terms increases interoperability across the entire industry. Nobody wants that taken away. Now, even though the legal terms themselves are valuable, I reckon most lawyers would consider the real work to be writing documents, not coming up with new terminology.

Well, we programmers consider the SDK - the *implementation* of the API - to be the real work. We consider the program - the *use* of the API in a code document - to be the real work. We don't consider the API to be the real work, except in rare circumstances that we with the proper technical knowledge will determine.

Nobody is suggesting the legal profession doesn't handle an important role in society. But if we expect them to be arbitrary domain experts, we're fucked. Yes, right now we have expert witnesses, but they take a secondary role in a trial. Unfortunately lawyers and judges still need too much domain knowledge, which leads to court exploitation by whomever has the technical knowledge.",programming,11,Supreme Court Denies Google Appeal on Oracle ,,1435587378,1594,johnmountain,538,1435642591.0,1435616178.0,11.0,0.0,0.0
